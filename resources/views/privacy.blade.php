        <h1>LEGACY CRUISES PRIVACY POLICY</h1>

<p>We have created this Privacy Policy (the “Policy”) because we value users’ privacy. The Policy describes the types of information we may collect from you, or that you may provide, when you access legacycruisessd.com (the “Site”). This Policy does not apply to information collected by any third party, including through any external website that may link to or be accessible from the Site. Please check directly with each such third party to avoid unfair surprises and misunderstandings.</p>

<li><h3>Cookie Policy </h3>
<p>Cookies are small text files which a website may put on your computer or mobile device when you first visit a site or page. The cookie will help our Site, or another website, to recognize your device the next time you visit. For example, cookies can help us to remember your username and preferences, analyze how well our website is performing, or even allow us to recommend content we believe will be most relevant to you.</p>
<p>We may use cookies for the following reasons and purposes:
</p>
<ul><li><i>To provide the service you have asked for.</i> Some cookies are essential so you can navigate through the website and use its features. Without these cookies, we would not be able to provide the services you’ve requested. For example, some cookies allow us to identify subscribers and ensure they can access the subscription only pages. If a subscriber opts to disable these cookies, the user will not be able to access all of the content that a subscription entitles them to. These cookies don't gather information about you that could be used for marketing or remembering where you've been on the internet. Essential cookies keep you logged in during your visit.
<li><i>To improve your browsing experience.</i> These cookies allow the website to remember choices you make, such as your language or region and they provide improved features. These cookies will help remembering your preferences and settings, including marketing preferences, remembering if you've filled in certain forms, so you're not asked to do it again, remembering if you've been to the Site before and restricting the number of times you're shown a particular advertisement. We might also use these cookies to highlight Site services that we think will be of interest to you based on your usage of the website.</li>
<li><i>Analytics.</i> To improve your experience on our Site, we like to keep track of what pages and links are popular and which ones don't get used so much to help us keep our Site relevant and up to date. It's also very useful to be able to identify trends of how people navigate (find their way through) our Site and if they get error messages from web pages. This group of cookies, often called “analytics cookies” are used to gather this information. These cookies don't collect information that identifies you. The information collected is anonymous and is grouped with the information from everyone else’s cookies. We can then see the overall patterns of usage rather than any one person’s activity.</li>
<li><i>To show advertising that is relevant to your interests.</i> We may sell space on our Site to advertisers. The resulting ads often contain cookies. These cookies are used to deliver adverts more relevant to you and your interests. They are also used to limit the number of times you see an advertisement as well as help measure the effectiveness of the advertising campaign. They are usually placed by advertising networks with our permission. They remember that you have visited a website and this information is shared with other organizations such as advertisers.</li></ul>
<p>Most browsers allow you to turn off cookies. To do this, look at the “help” menu on your browser. Switching off cookies may restrict your use of the Site and/or delay or affect the way in which it operates.</p></li>

<li><h3>Data security</h3>
<p>Personal information you provide to us is stored on a password protected server accessible only by administrator. We use SSL. However, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information transmitted to our Site because any transmission of information over the Internet has its inherent risks. Any transmission of personal information is at your own risk. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the Site. You are responsible for keeping your login credentials, if any, confidential.</p></li>

<li><h3>Children’s privacy</h3>
<p>Our Site is not directed to children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect any personal information about children under the age of 13. If we obtain actual knowledge that we have collected personal information about a child under the age of 13, that information will <p>be immediately deleted from our database. </p>
If a parent believes that his or her child has submitted personal information to us, he or she can contact us via e-mail. We will promptly delete the information upon learning that it relates to a child under the age of 13. Please note that it is possible some of this information may remain archived in web logs and back-up archives after we delete the information from our active database.</p></li>

<li><h3>International transfer</h3>
<p>Your information, including Personal Information, may be transferred to — and maintained on — computers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the data protection laws may differ than those from your jurisdiction.
If you are located outside the United States and choose to provide information to us, please note that we transfer the information, including personal information, to the United States and process it there. Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by your submission of information represents your agreement to that transfer.</p></li>

<li><h3>Accessing and correcting your personal information</h3>
<p>Please send us an e-mail to support@legacycruisessd.com to request access to, correct or delete any personal information that you have provided to us or to ask questions about this Privacy Policy. We reserve the right to refuse a request if we believe it would violate any law or cause the information to be incorrect. You can edit or delete your own information in your account settings. However, if you want to delete your whole account, then you have to contact us.</p>
