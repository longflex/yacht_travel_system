            <h3>OUR MISSION</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>Legacy is dedicated to creating for our selective clientele the kind of luxury cruise experience that is typically available only to the ultra-rich. Our flagship yacht has a storied legacy of its own, constructed with an ingenious design in the 1970s and thoroughly overhauled and upgraded to our exacting specifications.

        <h3>OUR VISION</h3>
        <hr>
        <div class="blue-content">
            <p>This is a commercial vessel built to last. The quality and workmanship of the fiberglass hull is second to none. The exceptionally wide-beamed hull provides unusually expansive deck space. Legacy has now enhanced this ingenious craft with wholly new fittings and flooring, adding a luxurious top deck to further expand guest capacity and comfort. </p>
            <p>Legacy has been exceptionally fortunate in the realization of our vision. Along the way we have fostered a close relationship with the local US Coast Guard office from the planning phase through the restoration phase, ensuring the highest levels of safety in construction. We have consulted with leading ship builders, renovators, and interior designers to fulfill our exacting specifications.</p>
